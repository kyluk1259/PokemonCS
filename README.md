# PokemonCS
So the program was working, and then it didn't work after I made no changes, so I had to revert to a copy that worked relatively well.
Unfortunately, battles and attacks are not fully implemented, and the complete map and 3 final battles are missing.
I still made sure that this version would run with functioning collision and the first bit of the map.
I'm not sure what caused the sudden spike in lag in the program, especially since I haven't changed a thing but sadly it is now incredibly slow.
I have no clue of what I should do to fix the problem, but the strange final builds are not on github as I couldn't push them from my macbook.
